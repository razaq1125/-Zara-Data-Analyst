# Zara Data Analyst Project

 # Overview
 
This repository houses the code and documentation for a comprehensive data analysis project focused on Zara, a leading multinational company in the fashion industry. The project leverages MySQL for data storage, Python for data manipulation and analysis, and Tableau for visualizations.

# Technologies Used
MySQL: Used as the relational database management system to store and manage the Zara dataset.

Python: Utilized for data manipulation, analysis, and exploratory data tasks. Key libraries include Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Tableau: Employed for creating interactive and insightful visualizations based on the analyzed data.

#Project Structure
The project is structured into distinct components:

MySQLScripts: Contains SQL scripts for database creation, data loading, and any necessary transformations.

PythonAnalysis: Houses Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and machine learning (if applicable).

TableauVisualizations: Holds the Tableau workbook with interactive dashboards and visualizations.

# MySQL Database
The MySQL database plays a central role in this project. The database schema is designed to capture relevant aspects of Zara's business, such as sales, inventory, and customer data. SQL scripts in the MySQLScripts directory detail database setup, data loading, and any necessary transformations.

# Python Analysis
Python is employed for data manipulation and analysis. Jupyter notebooks or scripts in the PythonAnalysis directory showcase the cleaning process, exploratory data analysis, statistical analyses, and any machine learning models applied to the Zara dataset.

# Tableau Visualization
Tableau is utilized to create compelling visualizations that provide insights into Zara's business. The TableauVisualizations directory contains the Tableau workbook with interactive dashboards and visual representations of key metrics and trends.

# Tableau Public
The visualizations generated using Tableau are shared on Tableau Public, allowing users to interact with and explore the insights derived from the Zara dataset.
